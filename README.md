# Polybius

A smart password generator. It generates an easy to remeber password based on relatable things, ideas or persons to you, while still being a hard to crack password, and hard to remember if you aren't you.

The software can ask you about your year of birth, favorite things, passions, persons, and combine letters or parts of words in a random order and way. Explaining you how it was generated so you can rember it.
