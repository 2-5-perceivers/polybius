A smart password generator. It generates an easy to remeber password based on relatable things, ideas or persons to you, while still being a hard to crack password, and hard to remember if you aren't you.

This is an almost fully functioning library. But as a program it's not yet. I plan to build a website using Yew maybe.

Using the example data: `Apples Bananas Oranges Lemons Cats Dogs Lover 2005 12 14`. It can generates passwords like:

>`05CatLeApp05Ora12A`\
2005 Cat Lemons Apples 2005 Oranges 12 Apples

> `2424141212LovAppBa`\
2024 2024 14 12 12 Lover Apples Bananas

> `A1424B2414Lov12`\
Apples 14 2024 Bananas 2024 14 Lover 12
